# This worklow will create a new GH release according to the current GRPC_VERSION value in variables.sh
# It is triggered after a PR from head "renovate/grpc-major-upgrade" is merged to master.

# 'renovate/grpc-major-upgrade' is a branch created by Renovate when it finds a new gRPC version to update in variables.sh
# Renovate with this worflow allows us to automatically create new releases whenever Google releases a new gRPC version in github.com/grpc/grpc

# All new versions created by this worflow will be suffixed by _0, e.g v1.46_0. At the moment, patches unrelated to the gRPC version (e.g v1.46_1)
# will still be released manually (for now).

# Note that once a new release is created in GH, a separate workflow will take care of releasing new docker images to dockerhub accordingly.
